Most pages involve multiple widgets which incorporate tables, graphs or similar graphic elements where it is not possible to enable the page to reflow to 400% zoom without scrolling.  We are working to ensure that any new part of the system that is created is composed in such a way that it is able to reflow correctly. We consider it a disproportionate burden to fix reflow for the legacy code.\nPreparation of this accessibility statementThis statement was prepared on 16 July 2024.This website was last tested in July 2024 against the WCAG 2.2  AA standard.The test was carried out by Oleeo using a range of automated tools.\nPreparation of this accessibility statement\n\n\n\nDisproportionate Burden Assessment for ReflowScopeAs of September 2018, accessibility legislation states that public sector websites must publish content in an accessible format.WCAG Success Criteria 1.4.10 stipulates that:Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.Currently most of our pages are set up in such a way that a two-dimensional layout is required.
