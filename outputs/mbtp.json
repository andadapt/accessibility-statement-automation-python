    "non_accessible": "If you find an issue that we have yet to identify, please contact us using the details in the ‘Reporting accessibility problems with this mobile application’ section of this statement.\nFocus not obscured\nThere are some links embedded within blocks of text which are difficult to navigate to using assistive technologies. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.11. We plan to fix this by March 2025.\nTarget size\nThe size of the target for the pointer input is not consistent across all app screens. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8. We plan to fix this by March 2025.\nRedundant entry\nSome information previously entered has to be entered again rather than being auto populated or available for the user to select. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7. We plan to fix this by March 2025.\nDisproportionate burden\nThe application may be difficult to use by people with mobility limitations or where their mobile device is in a fixed position. This includes:\nThe face scan feature only functions if used with the mobile device in portrait orientation, A fixed orientation of the screen (either landscape or portrait) that does not re-orient when the device is rotated. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation). Screens with a fixed portrait orientation have been designed to ensure visibility of all on-screen instructions.

    "non_accessible": "Keyboard navigation\nThe focus indicator is not visible enough, particularly so for buttons. Users\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith sight disabilities may have problems locating or tracking where\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent keyboard focus is. This fails WCAG 2.4.7 Focus visible.\nThere is no \"Skip to Main Content\" link at the top of the page that moves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfocus to the main content area. When navigating the site, focus is usually\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the main content area by default, but it would be useful to have a \"Skip\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Main Content\" link at the top of the page in order to skip repeated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent in the left panel if necessary. This fails WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass blocks\nUsing a screen reader\nWhere there are validation errors, these are not announced by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscreenreader. The error messages are displayed at the bottom of the page\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin red but a screenreader user is not made aware and would have to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnavigate the whole page using the arrow keys to find out what has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thappened. This fails WCAG 3.3.1 Error identification.\nIn the PBS SMS, when performing a search, the search results are not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced to a screen reader user. When clicking Next, the search results\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare displayed but a screenreader user is not informed, hence the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscreenreader user is unaware of what is happening and would have to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspend time navigating around the page to find the message. This fails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWCAG 4.1.3 Status messages.\nThe heading structure on many pages is not correct. There are skipped\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theading levels, and, in some cases, additional sub-headings would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuseful in order to aid navigation. Screenreader users may struggle to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstand the structure of the page, or it may take longer than necessary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto navigate to the section they want. This fails WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabels and 1.3.1 Info and relationships\nThere are no Landmarks defined so screenreader users cannot use them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly navigate to a section of a page that they want. This fails WCAG\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.3.1 Info and relationships\nOn most pages, the heading structure is not correct. Screenreader users\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay struggle to understand the structure of the page and might have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty navigating quickly to the area they want. This fails WCAG 1.3.1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInfo and relationships\nWhen using the navigation links in the left-hand panel, a screen reader user\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis not informed about them being expanded or collapsed. They would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunaware that clicking the link has revealed other sub-options or links. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfails WCAG 2.4.4 Link purpose in context\nFocus is also moved back to the top of the page. When subsequently\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoving down through the links in the expanded area they have no feedback\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the screen reader that these links are sub-links or hierarchical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScreen reader users would not have the full context of the link. This fails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWCAG 2.4.3- Focus Order\nOther issues\nContent does not reflow into a single column at 400% magnification. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcan make it difficult to read the content especially in the left panel. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent is generally ok up to 200% magnification. This fails WCAG 1.4.10\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReflow\nThe initial focus position is often in the wrong place on entry to the page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScreenreader and keyboard only users would be confused about the focus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torder. This fails WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order\nMost links are not underlined unless the user hovers the mouse over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlink. This means that colour is being used as the sole visible indicator of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlink.

This fails WCAG 1.3.1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInfo and relationships\nWhen using the navigation links in the left-hand panel, a screen reader user\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis not informed about them being expanded or collapsed. They would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunaware that clicking the link has revealed other sub-options or links. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfails WCAG 2.4.4 Link purpose in context\nFocus is also moved back to the top of the page. When subsequently\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoving down through the links in the expanded area they have no feedback\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the screen reader that these links are sub-links or hierarchical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScreen reader users would not have the full context of the link. This fails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWCAG 2.4.3- Focus Order\nOther issues\nContent does not reflow into a single column at 400% magnification. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcan make it difficult to read the content especially in the left panel. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent is generally ok up to 200% magnification. This fails WCAG 1.4.10\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReflow\nThe initial focus position is often in the wrong place on entry to the page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScreenreader and keyboard only users would be confused about the focus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torder. This fails WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order\nMost links are not underlined unless the user hovers the mouse over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlink. This means that colour is being used as the sole visible indicator of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlink. Users with sight disabilities or colour blindness may find it harder to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasily identify links on the page. This fails WCAG 1.4.1 Use of colour\nThere is an inactivity timeout, however, users are not warned when this is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclose to triggering and given the chance to extend their session. This could\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcause frustration for some users having to log back in and navigate back to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere they were. They also may lose some of the data they entered. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfails WCAG 2.2.1 Timing adjustable\nOn the Login page, autocomplete is not configured for the UserID and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPassword fields. This could cause frustration for some users as the fields\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould not prepopulate with information held in the browser meaning that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would need to type their UserID and Password in again. This fails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWCAG 3.3.8 Accessible authentication\nOn the Login and Forgotten Password pages the user is unable to view their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassword. This may make it harder for some users with disabilities to log in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are unable to check whether they have entered the correct\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassword. This fails WCAG 3.3.2- Labels or instructions\nSome address fields are missing visible labels. This could make it more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult for users of speech recognition software to move focus to these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfields. This fails WCAG 1.3.1 Info and relationships\nWe plan to resolve these issues by March 2026.\nDisproportionate burden\nAt this time, we have not made any disproportionate burden claims.\nContent that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations\nAt this time, we have not identified any content that is not within scope of the accessibility regulations.\nPreparation of this accessibility statement\nThis statement was prepared on 20thAugust 2025.
